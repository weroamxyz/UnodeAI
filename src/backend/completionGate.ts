 *  UnodeAi - Completion gate (verifier-as-gate, default path)
 *  The moat: a coordinator (PM) cannot report a goal "done" while the objective project checks
 *  (run_checks: build/type-check/test) are RED. This is the deterministic decision core only —
 *  pure, no I/O — so the deadlock-safety is unit-provable. The backend/orchestrator wires the
 *  async check run + retry/redelegate/handoff around it.
 *
 *  Deadlock guarantee: every failing cycle strictly increments `attempts`; once the bounded budget
 *  (self-fix retries + redelegations) is spent the only remaining outcome is `handoff` — a TERMINAL
 *  state that pauses for the human. There is no path that returns `retry` forever.
