/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  UnodeAi - Verifier (v0.7.0 verifier-as-gate)
 *  Runs the project's own verification (build / type-check / test, via `unode.verifyCommand`) in a
 *  given directory and reports pass / fail. This is the engine behind making verification a
 *  COMPLETION/MERGE condition rather than a nudge: the WorktreeCoordinator runs it in a worker's
 *  worktree before merging, so a crew only lands work that passes your project's checks.
 *
 *  Pure and injectable (no vscode): the command is read live (thunk) and the runner + policy are
 *  passed in, so it's unit-testable and shares CommandPolicy with the rest of the tool surface.
